Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02

Or /etext01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may 
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the 
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at

ЕПИЧЕСКИ ПЕСНИ

ХАРАМИИ - 1

          Отдавна гората слана ослани,
          ей късна веч есен придоде;
          мъгливи, невесели дойдоха дни -
          я свивай байрака, войводо! 

          Низ тъмни усои доволно е веч
          немили-недраги що бродим;
          полята ни родни са мощне далеч -
          време е назад да си ходим. 

          Не ни проработи туй лято честта,
          че лоша сме среща имали...
          Пролетес ний бехме най-силната чета,
          а най сме малцина остали. 

          По тъмни усои, по голи скали
          мнозина куршума завари -
          и ръфат месата им хищни орли,
          я вълци, юнашки другари. 

          А дома за тях е прехвръкнала вест...
          Когато се тамо вестиме,
          тъжовните майки в горката им чест
          сам бог знае как ще тешиме. 

          Отдавна веч техните бели власи
          е черна чембера обвила,
          и люта тъга им сърцето коси...
          Чест майчина - чест е немила. 

          Бащите ни в тъмни тъмници лежат,
          кой знае какво са те стали;
          у турците роби, неволи търпят
          жени и дечица ни мали. 

          А ний като вълци по нощния мрак
          немили, недраги все бродим...
          Войводо, я свивай ти кървав байрак,
          време е назад да си ходим!

                             

ХАРАМИИ - 2

          Земята тъмна нощ засени.
          Три харамии, три ранени
          другаря, се едвам крепят
          надолу из планинский път. 

          В зори стотина в боя бяха -
          и само те се отърваха;
          един до други те вървят
          по стръмния планински път. 

          Превързани са люти рани,
          ала по дрехи изподрани
          струи от кърви се вият
          и капят по планинский път. 

          Залюшнат грохна там едина;
          в замая другите двамина
          отминаха, без да се спрът,
          по стръмния планински път. 

          Ръка протегна и пошушна
          невнятно другий, и се люшна -
          и по очи се повали...Трупът
          запречи там планинский път. 

          Възпрян, другаря си погледна
          последния с усмивка бледна
          и рухна - труп върху трупът
          сред тесния планински път. 

          Души юнашки смърт засени...
          Пристъпват вълци настървени,
          отдавна дебнящи в мракът
          по върлия планински път.

                             
ХАРАМИИ - 3

          Грей чуждо слънце в тоя чужди край;
          устата жад, тъга душата трови.
          Зловещо дрънкат тежките окови...
          Ах, докога ли тоя път ще трай!

          Ей падна вечер. Грохнали, без мощ
          оковите си те едвам влечаха.
          В пустинята низамите ги спряха:
          ще се нощува тука тая нощ.

          Един о друг привързаха ги пак
          и скоро всички тежък сън обори.
          Един от тях очи си не затвори
          и бдя за дълго, буден в нощний мрак.

          Размерний ход на нощния стражар
          дочуваше едвам той в тишината,
          сегиз-тогиз и звън от железата
          на сепнат в съне някой свой другар.

          А борят го предсънници мечти -
          и през мечтите шепот му се стори...
          и в полудрямка той очи затвори -
          наяве чуден блян му се вести:

          Со ведър поглед, с усмех на уста,
          над него бе се майка му привела,
          ръката си на морното му чело
          бе сложила и тъй му дума тя:

          "Недей сърце на скърби вдава ти;
          край близък е на тежките неволи -
          че волята, що бди над хорски воли,
          веч иде свойта реч да възвести.

          Не вечна е световната беда,
          нито са вечни рабските окови; -
          виж, съмва - времена настават нови!"
          И кротко тя целуна го в уста.

          Очи откри той, сепнат на часът -
          но блянът блян в душата му остана...
          На тъмна нощ дошъл бе ден на смяна...
          Тъкмяха се другарите за път.

          Грей чуждо слънце в тоя чужди край;
          устата жад, тъга душата трови.
          Зловещо дрънкат тежките окови...
          Ах, докога ли тоя път ще трай!

                             
ЧУМАВИ

          Една е у майка, на братя седмина,
                  Петкана девойка напета,
          и дойдоха нея да искат Загорци
                  през девет села от десето.

          Босилко Радойкин, най-личен Загорец,
                  допратил е китени свати;
          Петкани невян и огърлица бисер,
                  а майци й похти с позлати.

          Шестима я братя не вричат, далеко -
                  и майка сама не пристава...
          Най-малък брат Лазар, един само склонен,
                  потихом ги тъй увещава:

          "Не връщайте, майко: такъва късмет се
                  не всякога пада на сгода;
          Босилко е личен и ударен момък,
                  из първи от първа е рода.

          Дали му се лесно доброто намира,
                  доброто и харното име?
          За връщане лесно - но вижте отпосле
                  сами да не се пишманиме.

          Далеко бил уж - това да е грижа!
                  Та ние сме братя седмина;
          наред по веднъж да й идем на гости -
                  и седем са пъти в година!"

          Полъга се стара Петканина майка,
                  несговорни братя склониха.
          Неделя бе днеска, през горна неделя
                  Петкана девойка жениха...

          И дома се върнаха весели братя
                  от сестрина сватба в Загоре:
          но щом сете върнаха, черната чума
                  сполетя ги в бащино дворе.

          И всички тя в гроба без време отвлече,
                  сал стара им майка пожали -
          да има гробове им кой да спохожда,
                  свещица за мъртви да пали.

          Осъмваше утром горката им майка
                  и вечер замръкваше тамо,
          от гроб на гроб ходи, нарича и плаче -
                  ден минва в наричане само.

          Гробове им черни реди и полива,
                  обкича с босил и върбина.
          И само отминва Лазаря гроба,
                  и Лазаря люто проклина:

          "О, бог да даде нестопен да останеш!
                  Дух бродник духът ти да стане...
          Че ти ме подстори, без време да женим
                  в далечно Загоре Петкана.

          Та няма днес кой в непосилна неволя
                  тъга от сърце да развърне...
          О, милост за тебе от бога да няма,
                  лице той от теб да отвърне!"

          И Лазарю вече докрай се додея
                  от майчини клетви зловоли,
          от майчини думи и тежки и грозни...
                  И той се на бога примоли:

          "О, чуеш ли, боже, от ден на ден стават
                  по-грозни, горчиви наветви,
          и сякаше змии се впиват дълбоко
                  в сърцето ми майчини клетви.

          Стори, пристори ми от шарен кръст плоска,
                  кон добър от дървено ложе,
          ошел бих, довел бих от пусто Загоре,
                  Петкана при майка си, боже!"

          И стори се чудо - чу господ молбата
                  и тесния гроб се разтвори.
          И яхна си Лазар припряната коня -
                  потегли направо в Загоре.

          Премина край девет села и отби се
                  в десетото, Каменна Чука,
          там право се спря на Петканини порти
                  и тихо на порти почука.

          "Стани, поемни от ръцете ми плоска
                  и хайде со мене Петкано,
          че седем сме сватби подигнали - дойдох
                  на весели сватби с покана!"

          Излезе Петкана, та брата посрещна,
                  ръка му цалуна, и тръпна,
          подникна го мълком под вежди и тъй му
                  сподавени думи пошъпна.

          "Защо ти са, братко, тъй жълти ръцете
                  и образа синкав, подпухнал?
          Болял ли си болест невярна, че тъй ти
                  миришеш на пръст, на подмухнал?"

          "От болест не ще е... Но къщи сме седем
                  подигнали, сестро, туй лято;
          на пръст аз доганям, че ред ми се падна
                  самси да префърлям земята."

          Петкана се върна, стъкми, премени се
                  со нова за сватба премяна -
          и тръгнаха. Ето, откакто на път са,
                  ден мина и други настана.

          Ей майчино село далеч се съзира;
                  през валог навлизат в лозята;
          в почуда озърна се плахо Петкана
          и с думи изви се към брата:

          "Мина виноберма и всички лозя са
                  обрани и вече прибрани,
          а нашите, братко, какво още чакат?
                  Виж, ронят ги черните врани!"

          "Лозята ги дадохме ние пролетес
                  на изпол, че много ни бяха;
          неволя слетя изполци другоселци -
                  лозята небрани остаха!"

          Ей дойдоха близо до самото село;
                  край село широки ливади.
          И още по-плахо, изново се брату
                  Петкана тогава обади:

          "Веч късна е есен, коситба се мина,
                  вей острия вятър есенни.
          Прибрани са хорски ливади - защо ли
                  сал наште стоят некосени?"

          "Пролетес отидоха в Добруджа пуста
                  вси братя на кяр цялолетен -
          самси не можах да сколасам навреме,
                  от болест невярна сполетен."

          "А къщите как ги сколасахте?" Лазар
                  наведе посърнало чело:
          "За къщите, сестро, не питай: ще видиш,
                  когато пристигнеме в село!"

          Вървят те през селото... И смаяни люде
                  изглеждат ги в страх мълчеливо -
          и бягат... Настръхнали псета по двори
                  баучат и грозно, и диво.

          Ей старата църква само посред село,
                  со бял зид висок обградена;
          изтракаха порти - излезе стария
                  со черен чембер прибрадена.

          Пристъпи през прага и очи подигна,
                  но смръзната тамо застана -
          юздата изпусна неволно и в ужас
                  към брата възви се Петкана.

          Но зърна пред нея как той се превърна 
                  на чад - и невидим изчезна...
          Кат гръмната мигом в почуди, Петкана
                  не сети от коня как слезна.

          Към майката щерка, към щерката майка
                  се спуснаха виком веднага -
          со плач сете живи пригърнаха двете;
                  и паднаха мъртви пред прага.

                             
ЦАР САМУИЛ

          "Мир, мир!" - едногласно военний съвет,
                  от грозната вест унесвесен,
          таз вечер реши... Во походний си плащ
                  загърнат, над стола надвесен,
          оборил бе горда глава Самуил,
                  в невесели мисли унесен.

          Пред тъмний му поглед безкрайно поле
                  завяно со сняг се разстила -
          и труп върху трупи... Свирепа е рат
                  там кръвна коситба косила...
          Оръжие сложили, живите в плян
                  отиват на робско чернило...

          Но ето че вестник и морен, и блед
                  промъкна се в шатра червений;
          пристъпи, застана и с нисък поклон
                  продума към царя смутений:
          "Завръщат се, царю, в Беласицкий бой
                  дванайсетте полка пленени!"

          И сепна се в мисли унесений цар,
                  претръпнаха вси воеводи.
          А той продължи: "Но завръщат се те
                  сакати и слепи нероди -
          на сто-душ е само оставен от тях
                  един едноок да ги води."

          И думи на думите грозни в ответ
                  се царю в сърце отзоваха:
          "Излез! Посрещни ги! - Или смелостта
                  се смръзна в душата ти плаха?"...
          Той стана, възлезе на ближния хълм;
                  след него войводи вървяха.

          В полето, загърнато в сняг, там далеч,
                  чак поглед дето достига,
          от глухия стан до смъглени гори,
                  извива се черна верига -
          люлей се, примъква се бавно насам,
                  и стон до небето се дига.

          Могъщия цар, пребледнял като смин,
                  към тъмната граница южна
          се взря и с закана издигна ръка
                  и нещо нечуто прошушна -
          но в миг залюлян, полетя настрана
                  и наземе възнак се люшна...

          Притекоха се воеводи завчас -
                  но царят веч мъртъв лежеше:
          по хладни му устни червена тъсма
                  кръв топла се излек струеше...
          А грозно войнишкият стон надалеч
          кат песен надгробна ехтеше.

                             
ЗМЕЙНОВО ЛЮБЕ

          Плахи звездици в небе потъмняха;
          рано без време петлите пропяха...
          В село се късни прибират жътварки.
          Хубава Яна припират другарки:

          "Яно, каква е таз твоя промяна?
          Весела беше за час и засмяна -
          що е че ходиш тъй грижна, неволна?
          Нещо потайно не би да си болна?"

          - Болна съм, дружки, зла болест ме бие,
          лазят ме тръпки, свеста ми се вие,
          вихър се кани, а прязнощ е тъмна...
          Кой знай до утре ще ли да осъмна!

          Ясния месец зад облак потъна;
          въхър налетя, дървета прегъна...
          Яна низ пътя се бъхти, превива;
          като веда е - ни мъртва, ни жива.

          Около нея в почуди жътварки;
          хубава Яна припират другарки:
          "Яно, що ходиш, що кършиш ръцете?
          Де ти е памет? Що е на сърце ти?"

          - Свива се сърце и памет се губи...
          Дружки, неверници, змейно ме люби.
          Пусти остали вси билки чемерни.
          Ох, не напусто са облаци черни! -

          Лавнаха псета далеко по двори,
          тъмното небо се надве разтвори -
          и стреловита светкавица блясна;
          от невиделица трясък се трясна.

          С трясък рой налетяха стихии:
          змееве, змеици с златни кочии -
          цялата рода на змея Огняна,
          сбрана на сватба по хубава Яна.

          Свиха, извиха - на вис полетяха.
          Миг само плахи жътварки съзряха,
          хубава Яна с незнайно си любе
          как се зад облаци тъмни загуби.

                             
ЛУД ГИДИЯ

          "Криво седи, право съди
                  стар кадия: -
          не оставя на мир село
                  луд гидия!

          Не е лудо като други
                  от селото -
          тамбура му яворова
                  на бедрото.

          Рано утром млад гидия
                  почва леко,
          свири леко, а се чуе
                  надалеко;

          надалеко по полето
                  до жътварки -
          сърпи пущат и зафърлят
                  паламарки.

          Плясват ръце и залавят
                  хоро вито -
          извиха се, изтъпкаха
                  златно жито...

          Дойде пладне, лудо-младо
                  не почива,
          колко свири, толкоз повеч
                  зле отива:

          че се чуе до невести
                  на реката -
          те забравят бухалките
                  и платната,

          та на хоро се залавят
                  пощурели,
          дойде порой и отвлече
                  платна бели...

          Падне вечер, луд гидия
                  не престава -
          на бабите край огнище
                  мир не дава;

          насам, натам - унесат се
                  в глас далечен;
          огън гасне - все зелника
                  недопечен!"

          Криво седи, право съди стар кадия:
          "Скоро тука тамбурата, луд гидия.

          Де, да видим що е това за свят чудо,
          как тъй става старо - младо, младо - лудо."

          Занаглася тамбурата момко млади -
          стар кадия по брадата се поглади;

          дръпна лудо теловете за налука -
          стар кадия кравай мустак позасука;

          ей го спрепна, ей го метна изведнъжка -
          че се сепна кадиево сърце мъжко;

          и непочнал истинската луд гидия -
          на юнашки нозе рипна стар кадия:

          сви, изви се чак от подът до тавана! -
          паницата с мастилото от дивана

          и торбите с харзували по стените,
          като пилци полетяха из мъглите...

          "Свири, свири, бог убил те, луд гидия,
          божа дарба не заптисва стар кадия!

          Свири, струвай старо-младо, младо-лудо:
          що е божа дарба - то за свят е чудо."

                             
КЪСМЕТ

          Когато господ-бог привърши в небесата
          небесни залисии, той слезе на земята
          и съзова по свят що имаше роди,
          световния късмет да им разпореди.

          Застана Турчина пред него първо тамо -
          на сърмошит чепкен ръкавите зад рамо -
          и стори темане. "Най-първи се вести,
          продума господ-бог - какво желаеш ти?"

          - Аллах - отвърна той, - дай мене Агалъка!
          Да владам, знаеш сам, това ми е най-сръка.
          Но воля твоя пак - каквото кажеш ти:
          човек върши туй, Аллах що отреди!

          "Да бъде!" - рече бог... А ей че се задава
          безочливия Грък: пред бога той застава,
          като че не пред бог, ами пред свой ортак -
          засукал на кравай чак до уши мустак.

          - О Кириос, дари на мене Агалъка -
          избърболеска той; - ти знаеш не за мъка
          е Гърка Грък роден... Късмет според човек!
          А пък поминъка со Агалък е лек.

          "Да - каза бог, - но виж, че Турчина превари
          и зе го. Избери ти дар от други дари."
          - Когато е така, дай мене  Х и т р о с т т а:
          и с нея видя щем да минем на света!

          "Да бъде!" - рече бок... А още недорекъл,
          ей чорлавий Еврей се прязглава затекъл,
          с брада до пояс чак, и блед и запъхтян,
          отмеря отдалеч метан подир метан.

          - Дай мене, Яхова, каквото ми се пада!
          На верния си раб дай малката награда -
          дай Агалъка мен... Мерак ми е това...
          И с малкото съм аз доволен, Яхова!

          "Ей, Агалъка го отнесе веч Агата,
          следнего Гърка пък отиде с Хитрината -
          остава..." - Яхова,  П а р а т а  дай тогаз!
          И с най-нищожното съм пак доволен аз.

          "Да бъде!" - рече бог... А ето низ баиря
          и Българина се задава най-подиря,
          нехайно замотал един през други крак,
          над вежди рунтави нахлупил сив калпак.

          Дохожда, спира се и все се пак втелесва,
          и гузно по тила с два пръста се почесва:
          - Дойдох ти, господи, да ме даруваш с дар -
          дари ми Агалъка... да бъда господар...

          "Де беше по-напред? Раздяла вече стана
          и зарад теб сега един късмет остана."
          - Прощавай, господи, по пътя закъснях:
          па малко и таквоз... на път се поуспах.

          Царвули нали е, изсъхнаха по жега,
          та да покиснат ги изух, да ми не стега,
          а пуста дрямка... На че там съм и заспал.
          "Затуй ще мъкнеш ти сега такава хал! -

          отвърна господ-бог: - Такъв ти е късметя!
          Кисни цървулите! И таз, що те сполетя,
          ти подир ралото влачи я чак до гроб...
          Земята работи - и неи бъди роб!"

                             
ПОЕТ

          С оръжие в ръка бе заловен
          той на Балкана и пред съд доведен.
          Последен изпит беше него ден,
          и неговия отговор последен.

          "Вий питате какъв съм! Втори път,
          чесъм поет ви вече отговарям.
          Защо въстанах? - казах пред съдът,
          но питате и аз ви пак повтарям:

          Обичам аз полето, сладкий дъх
          на неговите рожбици, цветята -
          и привечер кога ги милва лъх,
          и сутринта окъпани в росата.

          Щом цъфнеха напролет те, при тях
          от юг им птички идваха на гости.
          Аз от дете с тез птички другарях,
          че дивни бяха песните им прости.

          Свободни песни... не като онез,
          каквито ази пеях - и каквито
          сте и от други чували до днес;
          то бяха песни от сърце честито -

          сърце свободно, -сгряно от лучът
          на божието животворно слънце,
          и во което песните растът,
          като в поле посеяното зрънце.

          Такова слънце в моето сърце
          не грееше: - то в мрачина бе клето...
          И ази грабнах пушката в ръце
          да извоювам слънце за сърцето.

          Та песните, които то роди,
          на радост рожби, радости да сеят.
          Поета - тъй небото отреди -
          да пей, свободни птички както пеят..."

          *

          Присъдата бе смърт. На другий ден,
          преди зори, обесиха поета.
          Ръмеше дъжд и вятъра студен
          като въздишка стенеше в полето.

          И неми бяха влажните листа
          там на липата, дето той издъхна...
          Откакто на бесило стана тя,
          там песента на птичките заглъхна.

                             
СЪРЦЕ НА СЪРЦАТА

                         O love, I am not but love.
                                                   Shelley

          Алпийските вършини с леден поглед
          намръщеносе взират към Лагорн,
          о чийто цветни брегове морето
          се гали и со ромон тих им шепне
          най-свидните си блянове, родени
          в таинствените негови недра.
          Вей тих вечерник, песен насамотен
          рибар отнейде с себе си понесъл;
          а надалеч, към дрезгавия запад
          разпръснати, рой бели ветрила,
          подобно леки пеперуди, тънат
          на небосклона в огнените скути.

          По стръмний бряг дружина чужденци
          се спущаха, подзели буйна разпря.
          Един от тях, комуто во очите
          бе сякаше огледано небото,
          към другите извърнат проговори:
          "О, вярвайте, честит е само онзи,
          сърцето на когото е олтар,
          де пламъка на истината грей -
          и осветлява разумът." През реч
          преварил, други се обади там:
          - Блян на поета! Истината в него
          е враг на всяка истина в живота.
          Во истини що из сърце изхождат,
          намит щастье и наслада само
          на мисълта безкръвните аскети...
          Бъди Монблан! На висини възмогнат,
          обвий се с лед и с леден поглед гледай,
          това под тебе в мрака що гъмжи. -
          Но, в него взрян, ръка подигна Шелли -
          на горди думи с по-горд отговор:
          "Монблан да бъда? Съм! Но друг съм аз.
          На слънцето лучите, чойто чело
          що милват - искам с отблеска им аз
          да стопля туй, което смръзва той!...
          Туй който иска, нека дойде с мен.
          Към всякой връх по стръмен път се ходи
          и не една въздишка, не едно
          натякванье водача ще да чуе,
          от пътници, по него що вървят;
          но що от туй? Exselsior! Сами
          те благодарствен поглед ще обърнат
          към тебе - с теб на висини възйети."

          Сияеше во модрия му поглед
          таинствена и строга мощ. Безмълвно
          другарите вървяха подир него,
          залисани от гордия му порив.
          Невидимия дух на вдъхновенье,
          челото му засенил, с горд възторг
          говореше през неговите устни:

          "От суетните - суетна присъда!
          Присъда друга има: който сам
          е себе си постигнал, той живее
          во вечността и малко ще да знай,
          какво ще каже времето за него.
          И нека ви не плаши мисълта,
          че бъдещето ще повтори пак
          лъжите, неразбиранщините вети.
          Со смъртните и смъртното умира.
          Туй що на Лета тъмните вълни
          погълнат, няма да се върне вече
          со своя рев живота да смути.
          Век подир века в пъстра върволица
          ще се изнизват, нищо от предишний
          в послешний без повтора да намери...

          О, не! На дните в безконечний ход,
          едно, едно ще се повтори пак -
          към с в е т л и н а възвишений купнеж,
          към в и с ш е т о стремленията чисти
          и гордий, властен жад за и д е а л!
          Ще се повтори онова, което,
          в световните промени непроменно,
          е будило в човека человека
          и смисъл му е давало в живота.

          Честит е тоз избраник, чийто дух,
          като ковчегът Ноев, пренесе
          от прежний свят в послешний онова,
          което е в промени непроменно.
          Той подир смърт от себе си оставя
          най-чистото, най-хубавото - жица
          от царството на сенките безплътни,
          която ще го свързва с тоя мир."
          Те бяха слезли на самия бряг,
          там, дето ги възчакваше готова,
          люляна тихо над вълните лодка.
          Во дрезгавата далнина небото,
          с вечерний си лазурно-тъмен плащ,
          застилаше заспалото море,
          като сестра заспалия си брат.
          При сетнята раздяла се обърна
          пък друг сега и тихо проговори:

          - Небесен блян на земен син. Не всякой
          тъй над света, извърнат от света,
          високо би можал да се възмогне. -
          На рамото му сложи с горд замах
          ръката си, и тъй отвърна Шелли:
          "Домогвай се до себе си - и възмогнат
          ще бъдеш ти на тази висота!
          Грей божий плам на всякого в душата
          и му целта висока осветлява.
          Не се възпирай; дето простий смъртен
          смутен се спира - там хероя почва."

          Во лодката се отделиха трима.
          Под равний мах на леките весла
          тя тихо се понесе по морето;
          и галяха я тъмните вълни,
          тъй както галят блянове високи
          тям поверений, с тях възвисен дух.
          Другарите, там спрени на брегът,
          изпращаха им сетньо сбогом, шапки
          размахали в издигнати ръце -
          докле се татък лодката от поглед
          в дрезгавината вечерна изгуби.

          * * *

          Тъмней нощта. В вълшебна тишина
          спят небесата, слени с долний мир;
          и глухий шум на тъмните вълни
          един сред тая тишина говори -
          на бездната со говора злокобен.
          Кат блянове на всесветовен сън,
          блестят и гаснат ясните звезди,
          огледани во бездната лазурна.

          Попътний вятър лодката влече.
          Безшум се плъзгат пуснати весла
          и тримата другари, в разговор
          унесени, нехайно там седяха,
          без да съгледат облаците бурни,
          на буйна рат подобни, как прииждат
          и сбират се и трупат в небесата.

          Възлегнат на кърмилото един
          с въздъх към Шелли се така обърна:
          - Да; да не бяхме слаби! А защо,
          с това съзнанье, ощений се рвем
          да бъдем силни? Де е тази сила,
          що би могла и нази да окрили?
          "Тя в нас е! Бягай в себе си - живей
          в сърцето, като жрец в свещений храм,
          и твоя дух ще бъде окрилен!"

          - Утопия това е, Шелли. -

          "Утопия! И тъй да е - в живота
          утопиите само дават цел
          и человека во човека раждат.
          Утопии сърцето възродяват,
          превръщат го на рай цветущ, където
          мирът върховен свива свойто гняздо...
          Към идеала поглед възведи -
          не на умът, а на сърцето рожба -
          и знай, че той едничък е надежден
          компас в ревът на бурите световни.
          Тоз, който само с ум на тоя свят живей
          е жив мъртвец; и чужди са за него
          и радости и сълзи на живота, -
          защото няма той човешко чувство,
          защото нему чужд е дух човешки!...

          Що значи твоя страх, другарю мой?
          Къде си тъмен поглед устремил?
          Утопията проникни - и страх
          не ще намери твоето сърце!"

          - Над нас се вие буря! Или ти,
          унесен в своя блян, не виждаш нищо?
          Не бъдеще сънувано пред нас е -
          со мрачен поглед дебне ни смъртта! -
          Но го прекъсна Шелли, поглед сам
          към облачните небеса възйел:
          "През мрак и бура плавам с песен аз
          и нищо ми сърцето не смущава!
          На идеала фарът грей: кърмчия
          е любовта ми - дето и да съм,
          знам, ще изляза на честитий бряг!...

          Честитий бряг са бъдащите дни.
          Световните промени и несгоди
          ще мина аз - и няма те да хвърлят
          в сърцето ми отсянка... Никой вихър
          свещений плам на идеала няма
          да угаси - от божий дух е искра
          той: божий дух, из мрака битието
          що е извикал - в светлина живот
          да заживей... Другарю, то е блян,
          утопия - нали? Та нека бъде!
          Во знойната пустиня на живота,
          където всичко крей и мре, от билка
          най-дребна, до сърцето человешко, -
          живителна роса е тя, която
          запазва всичко в дивната му свежест.
          Пустиня е сърце без идеал:
          едничкий верен страж на любовта -
          а тя, и само тя, е на човека
          призванието висше на света."

          И бесен вихърсе над тях изви;
          като че звяр, изтръгнат от вериги,
          се хвърли той над тъмните вълни
          и гис бесът си зарази. Раззина
          зловеща паст настръхналата бездна,
          и оглуши тя с дивия си рев
          вселената... То беше мимолетен
          въртеж на бура ненадейна. Скоро
          премина той, и всичко пак утихна.
          Пак трепнаха звезди на небесата.
          Но мятаха се още все вълните
          и тласкаха там лодката разбита:
          ту мигновено в зиналата паст
          на бездната низвъргната летеше,
          ту навъзбог възйемаше се тя -
          и носеха я стръвните вълни
          към бреговете на незнаен край.

          *

          Пак бяха сбрани всичкиту другари
          на морский бряг. И сбрани бяха те
          пак да изпращат Шелли - но сега
          за сетен път - на път към вечността.

          Морето бе на пясъчния бряг
          изхвърлило избраната си жъртва: -
          на ниска клада сложен, буен плам
          обгръщаше останките му смъртни.

          В дълбока скръб, безмълвно там стояха
          другарите, унесени през мисли
          во онзи мир, во който през живот
          бе погледа му вдъхновен обърнат.
          Амфора во ръка еди издигнал,
          от час на час обливаше мъртвеца
          со благовонно вино - и подзети
          отново жадно пламнали езици
          обжегваха безжизнения труп...

          От вятъра отвяван, към морето
          се черний дим разстилаше полека...
          Огънят свърши своята отреда -
          на пясъка лежеше супа пепел
          с петна червено-тъмни; тук-таме
          береяха се кости.

                                          Изведнъж
          към пепелта един се спусна бързо
          и грабна из жаравата гореща
          опазен къс от трупа. Разтреперан
          издигна той ръка си обгорена -
          трептеше там сърцето на поета.

          ----------------------------------

          На гробищата протестантски в Рим,
          при урната на Цестия, лежат
          сърцето и световний прах на Шелли.
          Сребрист ясмин над гроба му расте,
          и пази сянка с тъмните си листи
          над мряморната плоча с златен надпис
          Cor cordium - Сърцето на сърцата.
          - Не е смъртта за него смърт. Пренесен
          в друг мир, живей той в нашите сърца
          и пази там, като весталка, чистий
          вълшебен плам на вечната любов.

                             
РАЛИЦА

          Като оназ вечерница в небото,
          една бе в село Ралица девойка,
          и цяло село лудо бе по нея.
          Сиротно чедо беше тя. Отколя
          замина нейний татко по гурбет -
          замина и ни вест, ни кост от него;
          а майка й отведоха с дене
          кахъри в гроба. Ралица остана
          при леля си, като свое чедо
          я тя отгледа - гърлицата както
          отглежда своя рожба, докато
          се на крила самичка тя възмогне.
          От Бешбунар ли с пълни бели менци
          тя привечер се връщаше с другарки,
          спреваряха се кой през кой вода
          да й напий; а в празник на хоро,
          кой не луди до нея да се хване? -
          Че модрия й поглед бе западнал,
          като мъгла, на всички на душата
          и мислите им все около нея
          се вияха, кат сърмений колан
          о кръшната й тънка половина...
          "Блазе й с хубост" - казваха едни.
          "Блазе, комуто на честта се падне" -
          обаждаха се други. А с глава
          посвиваха пък трети, век живели,
          свят опознали - шепнейки изниско:
          "Блазе й... Ех, кабил ни край не е
          на хубаво да води тая хубост."
          За Ралица залиташе най-вече
          Стоичко Влаха, заможен и личен
          ерген, един на майка и баща.
          Но ней сърцето беше дало вест
          и тегнеше душата й към други;
          примамили я бяха со дене
          на Ива Бойкин ваклите очи
          и думите му благи, като ранна
          роса при пролет. Вреди ли невреда,
          че сиромах е Иво!... Двама лика
          и прилика, един за друг родени -
          един у друг залюбени не чудом.
          Той беше строен явор столоват,
          тя тънка, вита, кършена лоза:
          лоза се окол явора обви -
          около Ива Ралица девойка!

          Кръстовден мина. По поля и дома
          се работа привършваха. Ей острий
          горняк повя: гората пожелтя;
          напуснати, посърнаха полята.

          У Ралица ходиха китни свати.
          И чу се вест низ селото, че наскоро
          ще е и сватба. Дружки и недружки
          у Ралица на добър час вървяха;
          и всички тя посрещаше засмяна,
          и тънки дари стелеше пред тях,
          и охолно разправяше на всички,
          що й лежеше драго на сърце.
          Сърце прелива, като пълна чаша.
          У лелини й дворове широки
          като че слънце грееше - и всички,
          що Ралица споходиха, оттам
          излазяха, като че ли и тях
          да бе огряло слънце...
                        Ала слънце,
          що за едни тъй драголюбно грей,
          на други мрак сгъстява на душата.
          И мрак обзе душата на Стоичка.
          Ни сън за него имаше, ни отдих;
          и скиташе се все навъсен той,
          на целий свят като че гневен. Вред
          той Ралица все дебнеше да срещне.
          Ей привечер веднъж му падна сгода
          на Бешбунар. Той излеком пристъпи
          и се запря зад чучура - когато,
          приведена над поставът, сама
          там Ралица си писаните стомни
          изплакваше. Тя втора стомна сложи
          под чучурчето - първата, веч пълна,
          изправи се да сложи отстрана -
          и тъй застана в миг, като вкопана.
          Обади се тогаз оттам Стоичко:
          "Отколя търся слука да ти дам
          скъп армаган - огърлица рубета,
          а, Ралице?..." И тутакси извади
          из пазвата си златен наниз той
          и го подаде. Очи не възведе
          да го погледне пребледняла тя
          и не пророни, слисана, ни дума.
          "Наречени са те за теб" - отново,
          пристъпвайки към нея, той повтори.
          - Не всичко, мен наречено, за мен е! -
          отвърна тихо Ралица и сегна
          препълнената стомна да отнеме.
          Ръката й тогава залови
          и я устреля с тъмен поглед той,
          и троснато отново тъй подзе:
          "За теб така... така ли е за мен?
          На мене е обречено сърце ти:
          то ще е мое - или ничие!"
          - Пусни!... Сърцето силом се не зема.
          Не е то пита, то се не ломи! -
          извика тя - изви се, отърва се
          и спусна се набързо низ брега.
          След нея дълго, дълго гледа той
          и недобър гореше плам в очи му.
          И паметта му мисли зли обзеха.
          Зашло бе вече слънце и бързом
          вечерни сенки падаха... Въз бряг
          възпираха отдолу закъснели
          за Бешбунар девойки и далеч
          разпръскваше се охолний им смях.
          Из друг път сви Стоичко и полека
          към село се упъти.
                           Много дни
          се оттогава минаха - и много
          неща през тия много дни. Ей вече
          великденските пости превалиха;
          разтиквяше се зимата. И всичко
          миришеше на млада пролет... Само
          мъглива есен гнездеше се още
          в душата на Стоичко Влаха, че
          отдавна вече Ралица и Иво -
          мъж и жена - живеяха честито.

          Зовеше я той "мое пиле", поглед
          от нея не отвождайки, като
          от свое скъпо, ненагледно благо.
          И не смъгли му щастието нищо -
          ни думите на Ралица, когато
          тя за Стоичко всичко му разправи,
          ни тъмний негов поглед, изпод вежди
          при всяка среща мятан неприветно.
          А радостта на Ивовата майка
          ни споделил би никой, ни постигнал.
          И всякой гост у Ралица бе драг
          и радушно причакан гост. На всички,
          кой знае как, усмивката й крехка
          допадаше - тъй ведрата зорница
          допада на стопани ранобудни:
          не е ли тя на ясни дни благ вестник?
          Ех, хубава усмивка беше тя...

          И с таз усмивка, привечер веднъж,
          говореше невястата на Ива,
          приседнала край огъня до него:
          - Защо ли се забави майка тъй?...
          Довчас ще втаса хляба и зарана
          ще имаш топъл за в гората. Ранко
          нал` ще излезеш? "Ранко, мое пиле;
          не ще ли ти се ранко да изляза?" -
          отвърна той, с усмивка дяволита
          като към нея се изви. - Пък ти!
          То вече - каза тя и причерви се
          свенливо. Двама млъкнаха завчас.
          На огъня притури съчки тя,
          а той се взря в камината нагоре.
          А вихъра, като пътник закъснял,
          на прозорците блъскаше, виеше
          и свиреше през ниския комин.
          Стояха дълго мълком те така
          и този път пръв Иво се обади:
          "У батеви останала е майка;
          ще трябва да се иде, че навън
          я чуй каква е хала разбесняла."
          - Пред вратнята завяло й до коляно -
          се Ралица обади, веч когато
          отвори той вратата да излезе.
          Но той не чу, набързо дръпнал пак
          да я затвори - че го сипна буйна
          виелица в очите, шепи сняг
          от стрехи нейде сграбил и вкъщи
          да се премъкне хукнала несвястно.
          Не задържа тя Ива. С сръчен мах
          от себе си отърси той снегът
          и възкриви към хлява, по-напред
          воловете да понагледа пътем.
          "Я гледай, чак и вратнята разтворил!"
          - Затрупай я с трупа си! - троснат глас
          до него се обади - и докле
          да се досети Иво, лют ханджар
          се вби в гърди му - дигна той ръка,
          изохка и се люшна на земята.
          И повторно в гърди му кат вби
          ханджара, викна стръвния убиец:
          - Мене нейни думи - тебе моя нож!
          Сърцето, що се не ломи, за мене
          ще да е цяло! - и прескокна той
          през трупа и изчезна в тъмнината,
          зловещо дето вихъра виеше.
          Нощта погълна глухий стон на Ива;
          а като че ли слаб, едва досетен
          ек и сърцето Ралица досегна -
          неясен ек и несъзнан, тъй както
          в гората гръм далечен от ловец
          на птичка се в сърцето отзовава;
          за миг се тя ослуша и отново
          я мисълта за утре пак обзе.

          Седеше тя прибрана тамо в къта,
          край огъня, когато се почука
          на прозорчето излек. Скокна тя
          и вратнята отвори. - "Добър вечер,
          невясто Ралко. Мала пък вихрушка! -
          бързом издума старата, чембер
          като отви и го от сняг отърси. -
          Ха затвори, че фтичето ще фръкне!"
          - Не е ли Иво отподире? - "Иво?
          Къде се е по таз вихрушка дявал?"
          И ней разправи Ралица, и плахо
          погледна я. "Ей, някъде по път
          ще бъдем се разминали" - изниско
          ней старата отвърна и повтори:
          "Отдавна ли излезе." - Не, отскоро. -
          Спогледаха се мълком те - и мълком
          край огъня приседнаха да чакат...
          Полека-лека вятърът утихна;
          и рядко само счуваха се бързи,
          отвън из пътя, стъпки и далеч
          заглъхваха; а тропота от тях
          за дълго се отйекваше в сърца им.
          И нещо тежко, тъмно се полека
          възйемаше и таеше в душа им,
          като на лято дъжд, кога в полето
          лежат вън златни снопи неприбрани.
          Тъй мина час и друг, а все нема
          очакваний от тях да се завърне...
          И наведнъж - поджегна ли ги мисъл
          нечакана? - те скокнаха и двете
          и литнаха на потръс. Пред вратата
          те зърнаха полузавени стъпки
          и като че ли нещо ги повлече
          нататък, закривиха... В тъмнината,
          зад зиналите вратни на обора,
          на трупа Ивов Ралица се спрепна
          и с вик върху му падна во несвяст.
          Далеч и близо в глъхналата нощ
          разлаяха се псета... Глъч се дигна;
          и стекоха се оближни съседи
          на писъка у Ивови. Блещукна
          фенерче сред навалицата - слабо
          огрея то прегърчения труп,
          зад прага възнак повален, с широко
          изцъклени безжизнени очи -
          и него с писък прегръщаха жените.
          Отнесоха съседи Ива вкъщи,
          а сутринта отнесоха го свои
          на гробищата, в вечната му къща.
          Пожалиха за чуждо чужди хора;
          пожалиха за Ралица, за Ива,
          окаяха и старата му майка,
          погаткаха "ка`би?" и "кой ще бъде?"
          па скоро и забравиха. Една
          не го забрави старата му майка
          и наскоро, при пролет, се помина.
          При синов гроб отвори се и майчин.
          Един до друг те легнаха в земята -
          и на сърцето Ралици. Злочеста,
          една за двама остана да жали,
          на гробовете им да реди.
                                        Начесто
          западаше й мисъл за Стоичка;
          западаше й: "Божичко, нима!?"
          И морници побиваха я хладни.
          (А сам Стоичко, заради когото
          и хората пошушноваха нещо,
          след Ивовата смърт, на два-три пъти
          се по кръчмите мярна - и без вест
          подир това на някъде забягна.)
          През сълзи тя не видя пролетта,
          в тъга не сети лятото как мина
          и дойде есен. Есента доби тя
          момчана рожба - радостна сълза
          во пороя на скърбите й падна.
          ----------------------------------
          Дни минаха и много мина с тях.
          Тъй както свива модрия седянко
          цветец, когато слънцето залезе,
          и тъй сърцето Ралица се сви,
          прибрало спомен скъп за ясни дни...
          Живей сиротно с своето сираче
          живот неволен тя сега. Радей
          по чужди къщи, бъхти се весден,
          и прязнощ я над хурката заваря.
          Но в ваклите очи на свойта рожба,
          когато се тя вгледа и познай
          в тях Ива - до сърце си го притисне,
          и пак оная хубава усмивка
          на устните й цъфва, от живота
          ненадломена - с несломено сърце.

                             
КОЛЕДАРИ

               Пролог

          Рог изви над върховете снежни
          ясен месец, подранил в небето.
          Глъхнали са в сън поля безбрежни
          само будно още бди селото -
          дим се вий на стълпи из комини.

          Песни, шум по улици се счуват;
          гости ходят, гости се посрещат.
          Домакини свят обичай чуват -
          Бъдни вечер бъден празник срещат,
          с буйно пламнал бъдник на камини.

          *

          Низ-по село скупом ходят
          китни млади коледари -
          сиромаси и боляри
          с благовестье да споходят,
          и наспроти празник честни
          да им пеят драги песни.

          Начело им станеника,
          той ги стани, той ги води:
          не току-така на сгоди,
          а където е прилика -
          и където подобава
          с песни да се слави слава!

                    Х о р

               "В дясна ръка с китка вита
               гости идат на честито:
               тежки порти отворете,
               благовестци пиремете!"

               Ей приветно портите разтваря
               за посрещи домакиня веща.
               А на прага къщен ги посреща
               стар стопанин и тям отговаря7

               "Добре дошле, добре дошле,
               многожелани гости,
               предвестници на благи дни
               и край на дълги пости!"

                    да вестиме
                    дни честити
                    именитий
                    станенину,

               Подранил стопан в поле да иди,
               лозя и ниви сам да обиди.

               Помисли благи - среща му блага:
               сам свети Йован, с златна тояга!

               - Добра ти среща, свети Йоване! -
               "Дал ти бог добро, честни стопане!

               Минах, поминах лозя и ниви:
               ръжта класиста коню до гриви,

               до шарен пояс бяла пшеница,
               гроздове тежки греят - жълтица!

               Стопанска грижа и труд усилен -
               тям за награда и дар обилен

               от божи ръце в твои да влезе:
               за по курбани, за по трапези,

               моми и момци за по венчене,
               внуци честити за по кръщене -

               тъй да се честно име спомина,
               от рода в рода, чак до амина."

                    Х о р

               "Пълна къща - пълен кош!"
               - Мятай, момне, шарен пош!
               Дар от сърце кой що може. -
               "Честит да е празник божи!"

                    Отдели се от другари
                    бърза коледарка спретна -
                    шарения пош преметна
                    стар стопанину през рамо...
                    Името му и честта му
                    пак запяват коледари.

               Х о р

               Расна дръво столовито,
                       грановито:
               корен в сърце на земята;
               връх извило в небесата!

               Корен - синове отбрани;
               а невести - китки грани;
                       внуци мили -
               вършки в небеса избили!

               Шум и глъч. Стопанин стари
               шарен пош от рамо снема,
               но преди на коледари
               той да го повърне с дари,
               хорът песен пак подзема.

               В т о р а   з а р е д а

               Тъмни ноще се пробуди
               мило внуче соколово;
               баба му се чудом чуди
               как да го приспи изново.

               - Нани, нанкай, рожбо мила,
               мало внуче, мал гидия!...
               Майка ти е сън заспала -
               от сън сладък не буди я!

               Баба ти, с зори ранила,
               дълга пътя ще пътува -
               чак до Божи гроба. Мила
               божа майка да я чува!

               Та оттам света хаджийка
               да се върне с армагани:
               тебе златен кръст на шийка,
               на герданче от мерджани;

               стари дяду броеници,
               татку свилен пояс дивни,
               майци наниз от жъртици,

               Дом докле захубавей,

               Но пък идва друга радост,

               Друго слънце дом огрей -
               въртокъщна млада булка...
               А во къта, в златна люлка

               Млад гурбетчия, по-млад стопанин,
               грижен ми ходи в пуста чужбина.
               Него запитват тихом дружина:
               - Що ти й насърце, грижен акранин?

               "Двойна неволя, верни другари:
               грижа на сърце, аман на душа -
               гори едното, друго задуша -
               вихром се вдигат спомени стари!

               Сръце примира, памет се губи;
               младост нерадост в пуста чужбина -
                       млада дружина,
               грижа за чедо - аман за любе!"

               - Ой, махни, махни кахъри люти,
               ти, млад другарин, недей се вайка:
               мило е любе при стара майка,
               грижено чедо в майчини скути.

               Много се мина, малко остана;
               утре ще литнат нагоре птички -
               вест допрати им ти с лястовички,
               че ще се върнеш при пролет ранна.

               Тежка версия весе е сбрана

                       Чакам другари. -
               Много се мина, малко остана!

               А невяста в ръце зела
               мъжка рожба, първо чедо,
               ником е чело привела,
               сълзи рони до два реда.

               Стара майка се притече,
               а по нея и момата,
               да раздумват с благи речи
               кахърите на душата.

               Съгледаха коледари,
               съгледаха и подзеха
               друга песен, со намяри

               галена рожба първородена.

               Благо усмихнат, старий стопанин
               тихом пристъпи при коледари,
               от шарен пояс вади кесия -
               да се за песен отплати с дари.

               Ала не иска сам станеника
               дари да земе и се отмята...
               Стар баща нещо со глава кивна,

               Сетено пръпна тя да излезе,

               А коледари момка напети

               С китка сминова на чело,
               в път застигна мома мала
               на седенки закъсняла.
               Викна лудо отдалеко:
               "Чакай, момне, по-полека,
               заедно да идем двама!"
               - Не е дума, ни измама,
               по мен стара майка иди -
               бягай, лудо, ще ни види! -
               Мома бърза и нехае;
               момку сръце бий, играе,

               Ясен месец облак крие -

               Стигнаха до равни двори:

               шарена плоска вниса момата,
               за песнопойци в жад прималнели.

               песни по сърце ней нагодили.
               Младого война зад себе скрили,

               думи шеговни хванала вяра;
               сам, да избегне глумна превара,
               момко задним се в къта издръпна...

               Уж в изненада сам, станеника
               наколедарки сопнато свика,

               и при невяста грижна пристъпи,
               дигнала в ръце първенак скъпи.

               С пръст го по гушка мило погали:
               "Иска ли песен, гидия мали?

               Татко и майци попано чедо!
               Хай, та и нему двойна зареда

               с отбрана песен чест ще възхвали!
               Иска ли песен, аждерко мали?"

               Повтор погали рожбата дивна
               и към певачи со глава кивна.

               Дружно се първа зареда
               там при невяста скупом събраха
               та со отбрана песен припяха
               в майчини скути шалаво чедо.

               Хор

                   В полунощи, време тайно,
                   над люлка на рожба драга,
                   спря се наречница блага,
                   прилетяла от незнайно.

                   Час се спря и час нарече:
                   "Ясно чедо, първородно,
                   с блага вест на време сгодно,
                   бог ме прати отдалече.

                   На честит си ден родено,
                   за дни още по-честити -
                   с тебе майка да се кити,
                   като с перо позлатено.

                   В труд, в грижи, в заборави
                   татку си надежда ясна...
                   Да расте и да порасне -
                   дом подигне, род прослави!

                   Да върви из път световни
                   към доброто с крепка вяра,
                   да не снайде зла превара
                   помислите му грижовни!

                   Дни на младостта му лека,
                   като зорница да са ясни -
                   и в сърце му да не гасне
                   чиста обич век до века!

               П ъ р в а  з а р е д а

               И во тоя дом честити,
               що го чиста вяра кити,
               да не сяква все що драго -
               руйно вино, мед и благо,

               Бог да дава
               вкъщи слава -
               дни честити,
               чиста съвест!

               Дар в полето,
               дар в сърцето -
               добра мисъл,
               мир и милост!

               Хор

               Тебе пеем, станенине,
               тебе славим, господине:

               Колко здравец по гората,

               толкоз здраве у палати -
                       живот - почит -

               На копраля над върхове снежни
               е отскочил месечко в небото,
               глъхнали са в сън поля безбрежни,
               само будно още бди селото -
               слава слави спроти празник честни.
               Коледари низ-по село ходят,
               песента им се далеко счува...
               Станеник ги води да споходят
               дом, обичай свят къде се чува -
               Бъден празник да се слави с песни.

                             
НЕРАЗДЕЛНИ

          Стройна се Калина вие над брегът усамотени,
          кичест Явор клони сплита в нейни вейчици зелени.

          Уморен, под тях на сянка аз отбих се да почина,
          и така ми тайната си повери сама Калина -

          с шепота на плахи листи, шепот сладък и тъжовен:
          "Някога си бях девойка аз на тоя свят лъжовен.

          Грееше ме драголюбно ясно слънце от небето,
          ах, но друго слънце мене вече грееше в сърцето!

          И не грееше туй слънце от високо, от далеко -
          грееше ме, гледаше ме от съседски двор напреко.

          Гледаше ме сутрин, вечер Иво там от бели двори
          и тъжовна аз го слушах, той да пее и говори:

          "Първо либе, първа севдо, не копней, недей се вайка,
          че каил за нас не стават моя татко, твойта майка.

          Верни думи, верна обич, има ли за тях развала?
          За сърцата що се любят и смъртта не е раздяла."

          Думите му бяха сладки - бяха мъките горчиви -
          писано било та ние да се не сбереме живи...

          Привечер веднъж се връщах с бели менци от чешмата
          и навалица заварих да се трупа от махлата,

          тъкмо пред високи порти, там на Ивовите двори, -
          "Клетника - дочух между им да се шушне и говори: -

          право се убол в сърцето - ножчето му още тамо!"
          Аз изтръпнах и изпуснах бели медници от рамо.

          През навалицата виком полетях и се промъкнах,
          видях Ива, видях кърви... и не сетих как измъкнах

          остро ножче из сърце му и в сърцето си забих го,
          върху Ива мъртва паднах и в прегръдки си обвих го...

          Нек' сега ни се нарадват, мене майка, нему татко:
          мъртви ние пак се любим и смъртта за нас е сладка!

          Не в черковний двор зариха на любовта двете жъртви -
          тамо ровят само тия, дето истински са мъртви -

          а погребаха ни тука, на брегът край таз долина...
          Той израстна кичест Явор, а до него аз Калина; -

          той ме е прегърнал с клони, аз съм в него вейки свряла,
          За сърцата що се любят и смъртта не е раздяла..."

          Дълго аз стоях и слушах, там под сянката унесен,
          и това що чух, изпях го в тази моя тъжна песен.

                             
БОЙКО

          Три вечери поредом обикаля
          край Недените пусти двори Бойко,
          три вечери въртя го тъмен шемет
          и дълги дни подир това мъгла -
          и пред очи и на сърце му тегна.
          Измамата живота му вгорчи.
          "Не бери грижа, чедо, преди време -
          раздумваше го майка му - сам знаеш:
          измама що е хранило, нича
          зарад сърце такова някой тъжи!"

          И прави думи. Неведнъж и сам
          си ги е шепнал на сърцето Бойко.
          а все пак нещо свива туй сърце.
          И палавите прязнощни звездици,
          що всяка вечер го така безгрижен
          на одъра заварваха - сега
          заваряха го, ненадвит от сън,
          като обжегнат тамо да се мята.
          А сякаше напук, из село нейде
          извиваше с цафарата си медна
          унесено нехайник някой млад:
          подкършената изподтихом песен
          ехтеше с пуста жалба зарад младост
          и чезнеше за дваж по-пуста обич.
          А времето фърчи, не го е грижа
          кому тежи, нито кому е леко, -
          то неусетно челото на Бойка
          приведе и над тъмния му поглед
          дълбока сянка на тъга заметна.
          не беше вече онзи Бойко той,
          на всички драг - седенките без него,
          седенки що не биваха, нито
          хоро хорото. Ни кой не попита
          какво му е на младото сърце;
          па и да пита, казва ли се с думи
          сърцето как тъгува за севда!
          Не питаха го и защо така
          е работа напуснал той. И свои,
          и другоселци идваха при него,
          като при първи майстор бъчевар -
          че работата майстора си дири;
          ала на младий майстор се отщя
          от майсторлък и работа, откак
          изгората му дните изгори...
          Не дига се за работа ръка,
          когато падне мъка на сърце.

          На край на лято - другата година -
          веднъж и дваж му майка позагатна,
          тъй изделеч, доде потрети ясно:
          (те пред оджака привечер седяха)
          "Било билото, чедо: все, що бива,
          се с дни забравя... Ех, не доживя,
          той татко ти - барем, докле са дни
          да видя и аз отмяна, на унуче
          да се порадвам..." Не отвърна Бойко
          на майчини си думи. Изпод вежди
          я сал озърна и приведе чело;
          и странн се усмивка застоя
          на устните му. Кой знай, белки нещо
          да каже трепна таз усмивка тиха -
          и пак изчезна няма, както дойде!
          С това се свърши само нея вечер.
          А наскоро и онова, нает,
          що бе сторила старата му майка,
          се свърши: мина и не мина време,
          доведе тя от бащино му село
          къщовница и угледна, и спретна.

          Кой знай как пристана лесно Бойко.
          Наистина, то приказки не ще -
          хатър се майчин лесно не прекърша,
          но все пак... Да; а булче му се падна
          на чест, не булче - злато. Позлати
          то Бойковата къща и зарадва
          старешко сърце майчино. И често
          "Сполай ти, боже - шъпнеше си тя,
          като я гледа спретна и засмяна
          из къщи да реди, - сполай, че мен
          и чедото ми с тая чест дари!"

          Но радостта й бе едно горчило
          това, че все намръщен ходи Бойко
          и някак си като замаян; реч
          съвсем нарядко из уста изустя;
          понякога не вижда, не дочува,
          но бо`зна де по цели дни из къщи
          се дява. Майци на сърце това
          зле падаше, но лесно се придумва
          за чедо майка тъй сама-самичка -
          нали со време се оправя!

          Над къщи зло се виеше, а зла
          не чу се дума. Тъй се мина зима,
          запролети се, лято прелетя -
          ей дойде есен. Още гроздобер,
          и работата полска се привърша;
          започнаха за зимници да готвят
          от овреме къщовници стопани.

          Такъв къщовник беше Ненко Бъта,
          мъжът на Неда, Бойков едновръстник,
          И привечер, завръщайки се пътьом
          от работа, при Бойка той завърна:
          "Чуй, дома чакат съдове; мини,
          когато сгода тия дни ти падне."

          Зашеметиха тия прости думи
          сърце и памет Бойку, както есен
          зашеметява вихър сух листец,
          на вейката си още все крепен.
          И два дни ходи той като в несвяст.
          На ранина, на третий ден, у тях се
          со сечивата Бойко озова...
          На двора бяха съдовете сбрани
          и залови се той за тях, очи
          без да възвие окол да погледне.

          Преви към пладне: ратаите мудно
          от работа из двора се прибраха.
          Тогава счу зад себе стъпки той
          и поздрав излек: "Бог помози, Бойко!"

          И тутакси той сепнат се обърна -
          а бяла Неда вече там нататък
          отминаваше, с кобилица на рамо.
          И щя не щя, а все пак фърли той
          след нея поглед - и съгледа как
          тя възкриви зад порти: бял чембер
          подире й се метна и затули.
          Ала се тя за дълго не забави.
          И тоя път, на връщане, пред него
          запря, на рамо с менците ковани,
          като продума: "Думам му отдавна -
          ще се разсипят съдове... ех, знайш я,
          какъвто си е Ненко... Ами ти
          какво си, Бойко?" ала я не чу
          той тоя път - наместо длето, свредел
          заврял в готова цепка, да затъква
          наместено на сгода лико... "Зер -
          тя поднови - кажи го, второ лято
          отка` не сме се виждали... А, Бойко?"
          - Две лета, Недо - като под земя
          се той обади... - Харно са, сполай -
          от майка много здраве..." Постоя -
          и първа тя отново пак подзе:
          "На ранина замина Ненко с тейка
          в Загоре... Време мярка се, минува,
          сън сякаше сънуваш!" - Ех, сънувах!
          И сън ли беше! - смутолеви той...
          И стори му се работата вече
          като да е привършил, и набързо
          сбра сечива, наканен да си ходи;
          но се изправи, застоя се, някак
          учуден: "Тук? Че как така? Защо?..."
          А вперила во него модри очи,
          като че ли тя искаше това,
          що не издума с замъглени думи,
          да го додума с поглед - "Дълга нощ,
          и Ненко е в Загоре"... Като нож
          пробиха сърце Бойково тез думи! -
          "Остай си сбогом!" - Сбогом... много здраве!

          Невяста Райка още не се беше
          отсрамила и срам над къщи падна.
          Тъй бива то... Край плет помине някой,
          лулата си отърси и замине,
          а, току-виж, подпушило завчас:
          повейне ветрец - и гони белата!
          Отде повя сирака, той самичък
          си знаеше - а тласна го залисан
          во бурята на чувства, що душа му
          опустошиха, първий вихър още
          несмогнала да преживее - както
          гора в пожар: недогасена искра
          избий и с двойна сила плам се емва,
          и зелента превръща се на пустош.
          Не го свъртя во къщи веч съвсем
          и работата, подновена пак,
          като обувка скъсана подритна
          и се извърна той в несвяст от нея.
          Па и сама се работа извърна
          от майстора, полека, неусетно.
          И да се не извърне! Со зори
          излезе чак - чак вечер се додътри,
          нарязан гръста. Работа го чака
          и хората припират - ден за ден,
          и никой веч при него не завръща...
          Търпеньето е с край. Не изтърпя
          неволната му майка; ала кешки
          до гроб да бе търпяла - не би чула
          от чедото си нечедовни думи.
          Когато му натякна тя - за смях
          и на децата че е станал вече -
          извърна се той сопнато към нея:
          "Теб що ти е? Нали на мен се смеят!
          Аз и смехът, и мъката си зная."
          Ни думица горката му невяста
          не смя да каже; денем по шетня,
          по работа насам-натам, а сутрин
          притуляше възглавието си, мокро
          от сълзи, майка да го не съгледа.

          И ето пак за всички драга пролет
          довя долняка топъл откъм юг.
          За работа се хора заловиха,
          а Бойко плъзне все по механите.
          Дома намръщен и по механите
          такъв по цели недели - и в миг
          налетя го на гняв и ядни думи,
          от тъмното мълчание по-зли,
          и няма край... През лятна жега тъй
          се мъкнат мудно тежки дни и мъка
          е на душата, а когато рухне
          дъжд и градушка, дваж по дотежней.
          Изходиха и врачки, и знахари,
          какво не му замесваха во хляба,
          с какво не билье нощем го димиха -
          не би късмет. С магии скритом вшити
          в елека, той излизаше из къщи
          и връщаше се вечер пак пиян.
          Как падаше невести на сърце,
          какво тежеше мйци на душата,
          що ги е чужди еня - път минават,
          безпътни думи думат: "Бъчеваря
          завърза пъп за бъчвата!" Не страя
          и не понесе срам на старини,
          при пролет още грижната му майка
          на одъра се гътна - и не стана.
          При смъртний час доведоха пиян
          от механата Бойка. Но от него
          се старата отвърна с тежки думи:
          "Да ти не бъде просто ни от бога,
          нито от майка, синко!" - издъхна.
          Главата му со друго беше пълна
          и майчините думи дали той
          чу и разбра, кой знае. Само сбра
          устата му усмивка странна; миг
          на устните му застояна, тихо
          изчезна тя, тъй както се яви...
          Ей на изход година, откакто Бойко
          се бе оженил - и година как е
          живота на невястата почернил.
          И мълком тя пренасяше обиди
          от някога обичния си мъж,
          и мълком сълзи ронеше - в света
          саминка, като капчица на стряха.
          "Живот е даден - всякой во живота
          с честта си" - тъй раздумваше се тя
          со майчини си думи, и се плахо
          ослушваше в сърце си, че под него
          се беш ерожба зародила. Бойку
          тя неведнъж наканва се да каже,
          а нещо я за гърлото притисне
          и вместо думи сълзи я избият.
          Сам можеше и той да види ясно,
          невястата му че ще стане майка
          наскоро, ала кой ти я поглежда!
          А приближава съдбоносний ден
          и го сеща... Нещо й е мъчно
          и радостно - и иска й се нему
          да повери туй, що душа й мъчи
          и тайно радва: "Негли пък това
          го сепне, друго ако не помага!"

          Отдавна слънце зайде и нощта
          над уморено село се надвеси.
          Прибират се работници дома,
          коля скриптят, понесли от полето
          на гумна тежки снопи... Отдалеч
          тя стъпките неравни на мъжът си
          дозе, на прага къщен се изправи
          да го посрещне. Залюляно той
          пред нея се възпря и я кръвнишки
          изгледа изпод вежди: "Да не би
          и ти да ми запречаш път!" - се сопна,
          и на жена си погледа свенлив,
          без да съгледа - хласна я с коляно,
          събори я на подът и отмина,
          като промъмра, скърцайки со зъби:
          "Че в механата ми отбиха път -
          и ти ли пък ще ми отбиваш вкъщи!"

          През нея нощ во мъки тя доби
          без време първа - и последня рожба.
          Ненавремните мъки не понесе
          и легна тя на одъра, за нивга
          да се не дигне. Грижните съседки
          около нея шетаха, а тя
          безпаметна се мяташе в леглото,
          нашепнувайки с устни загорели
          несвестни думи и на подкървени
          очи со поглед неподвжижно вгледан.
          Нерядко тя дохождаше на себе
          и все, напусто, с думи и со поглед
          за рожбата си пита: ала никой
          не посмей дори да й загатне
          къде е тя, какво со нея стана,
          и само я тешаха со измами,
          че някоя и н`ам-къде си уж
          детето е прибрала на кърма,
          докато се от болест тя продигне.
          Кой би й казал и какво - на майка
          при смърт, за рожба мъртвородна?

          Събрани бяха привечер веднъж
          съседките при болната родилка
          и нея те - за време укротена
          от огницата - со поволни думи
          разтушваха. А тъкмо се и Бойко
          тогаз завърна вкъщи. Пред вратата
          той, без да иска, се възпря и вслуша
          во говора, що идеше отвътре.
          И чу той ясно думи на жена си:
          "Подхлъзнах се из стълбата, а то
          не му бе време... подир месец, два...
          Нали било му писано... Понесох
          по стълба менци, и н`ам как со тях
          на подплес стъпих - та на двора чак...
          Ех, божичко, па нея нощ!" И нищо
          не чу нататък Бойко. Спря се той
          и като се че нещо вби в душа му,
          зави му памет и сърцето стисна,
          като приклещен пръст между врати.
          Какво бе туй? С лъжовни думи тя
          закриля тоя, който младостта й
          почерни, който с първата си рожба
          уби? Не е ли туй насън? С какво ли
          за нея той е драг, та го закриля
          пред хората?!
                  И цяла нощ се той
          по двора лута, сякаш тия думи
          в душата му откриха пропастта
          и в ужас той дълбоко и дълбоко
          се в тая пропаст взира - и потърсен
          самичък се от себе си отвърна...
          И дълга бе за него тая нощ,
          по-дълга от денете, преживени
          с извърнато сърце от всичко мило,
          милеящо за него во неволя.
          И неведнъж през нея нощ пристъпя
          към прага той - а не посмя да влезе.
          -------------------------------------
          На третий ден, с приведена глава
          вървеше той след черното носило
          на своята неволница невяста...
          Затвориха новоотворен гроб -
          разидоха се хората - тъмней
          черковний двор... Потихия вечерник
          люлей надгробни бурени и тям
          потайно нещо като че ли шепне.
          Над току-що засипания гроб
          застанал, Бойко като вкаменен,
          като надгробен камък, неподвижно
          с оборена глава на гръд стоя,
          докле се спусна тъмна нощ. Тогава
          упъти се към къщи той. И пак
          не посмей през къщний праг да влезе,
          а седна вън на ниския чардак,
          закри лице с ръка - и първи път
          студената самотност го обгърна
          и из очи му хлътнали изтръгна
          сълзи, незнайни досега за него...

          А надалеко нейде си из село,
          унесено нехайник някой млад
          извиваше с цафарата си медна.
          Подкършената изподтихом песен
          ехтеше с пуста жалба зарад младост
          и чезнеше за дваж по-пуста обич.

                             
ПО ЖЪТВА

          Постатта поведе сръчно бяла Неда;
          Стаменко по нея сили да преваря -
          Неда шеговито изпод вежди гледа,
          той и тъй, усмихнат, неи отговаря:

          "Бързай, бяла Недо, облог с тебе бия -
          не те ли спреваря, давам, душо блага,
          пръстен на ръката, нанизи на шия,
          и сърце придавам - придан тебе драга."

          Бърза бяла Неда, жъне и отваля,
          а сързе й трепка, като птичка плаха...
          Слънцето отскочи вече на копраля,
          морните жетвари на похапка спряха.

          Само бяла Неда сърпът не оставя,
          почив и похапка - кой за тях ти мари...
          "Да му мисли, който облог се залавя!" -
          Стамена подкачат охолни другари.

          Слънце спря на пладне. Ветрец не подухва
          и омара трепка над поле. На завят
          морната дружина седна да пладнува;
          само те двамина сърпи не оставят.

          Двайсет пъти вече постат подновиха -
          нито той настига, нито тя остая...
          В слепи очи бие кръв младежка лихо,
          погледи примрежа слънчова замая.

          Щом да отмалнеят сили заморени,
          младо сърце пак ги с порив нов подйема...
          Падна вечер. Неда дружките засмени
          дразнят: "Зор голям е - по сведа голема!"

          Ясно слънце зайде зад балкан далечен,
          над полето лъхне преднощна прохлада,
          да привърши всякой своя труд уречен
          старий драгоманин виком заповяда.

          Стаменко и Неда, както в зори ранни
          почнаха, така се настигнали спряха...
          Охолни жътвари, около им сбрани,
          право се в очите Стаменку присмяха...

          "Пръждома! Не облог - аз шега си бия!" -
          бледе той извика, устни стиснал ядно...
          Люшка се и възнак бяла Неда падна -
          остра дума, остър нож в сърце проби я.

          Стекоха се дружки с вик от изненада,
          милват я, с водица пръскат бледо чело.
          Всуе... Млади дружки дружката си млада
          понесоха мъртва плачешком към село.
                          
БАЧО КИРО

          Тоз ден обесиха Бача ви Кира -
          вече забравих коя бе година -
          другите, с него що бяха, стотина,
          се отърваха. Ех, то се разбира! 

          Този не ял и дори не мирисал
          лук; я пък оня ахмак се преструва;
          трети се кръсти: "Та кой би уйдисал
          на хаймани по умът! Да бунтува? 

          Против кого? За какво? И защо ли?
          Царя ни благ е, аллах да го чува!
          Вече престанаха сълзи, неволи
          и кръвнините, откак той царува..." 

          Ето пък онзи там скута цалува
          на едно мурго ефенди надуто:
          "Аго, аллах да ти дните съчува:
          мене ме хайти подлъгаха люто." 

          Бачо ви Киро стои и ги гледа
          и му се в сълзи сърцето облива:
          "Боже прости, за такива говеда
          исках свобода и аз... за такива..." 

          И, недорекъл, напред се изстъпи -
          воля е, чужда я воля не спира:
          "Ето, живота за други е скъпи -
          той е омразен за Бача ви Кира! 

          Всички, що видите тука пред вази,
          те са невинни - и тия в затвора...
          Аз съм виновен, един само ази -
          че съм говедата смятал за хора. 

          Аз съм виновен! И с Бача си Кира
          щото ви скимне такова правете -
          духом свободний свободно умира,
          а си не връзва с живота ръцете!" 

          И покачен бе за свойта измама
          той на бесилката...ех, сиромаха! -
          И остстрани му разбойници двама:
          както Исуса когато разпнаха.
